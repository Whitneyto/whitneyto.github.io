- simple projects will be linked to the HTML page (first project from last week)
- I have been reading tutorials on [reactjs.org](https://reactjs.org/) and will be continue to dive deeper into the content
- Also, I will look at snippets for example for better understanding on using REACT JSX, [W3School](https://www.w3schools.com/REACT/react_jsx.asp) seems like a good source.
- And will explore more about git, html and css along the way of making other projects.
